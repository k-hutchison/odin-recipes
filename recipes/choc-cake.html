    <h3>Description</h2>
    <p>
       Elevation can cause a lot of changes with baking. At greater than 6000 feet above sea level, this chocolate cake is moist, holds it shape, and is packed full of chocolate flavor.

        <li>2 c flour</li>
        <li>1 3/4 c sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 c dutch processed cocoa</li>
        <li>2 tbs instant espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees, and spray the bottoms of three 8 inch cake pans with non stick spray.</li>
        <li>In large bowel, sift flour, sugar, cocoa powder, espresso powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.</li>
        <li>Separately, whisk together the eggs, milk, sour cream, oil and vanilla. Add the wet ingredients to the dry, and whisk until combined.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter between the pans. Bake on the center oven rack for about 22-28 minutes, until the tops of the cake spring back when lightly touched, or a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. </li>
        <li>Bake until cookies are puffed and slightly brown, about 22 minutes.</li>
        <li>Set the pans on a cooling rack, cover loosely with a clean kitchen towel, and cool completely before frosting. </li>
    </ol>
